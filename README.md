# Gatsby Basic

This is a super basic starting point for Gatsby that has:

* some scaffolding for flat pages
* some components
* a main stylesheet
* gatsby-image support
* scss support
* Helmet support

You'll have to BYOB (bring your own blog)

## Usage

From your command line:

    gatsby new name-of-site https://github.com/abeeken/gatsby-basic.git
    cd name-of-site
    gatsby develop

Enjoy!
